Other meanings: good prospects, good chance, renewal or rebirth, many plans. The jester can also indicate some uncertainty, a state of chaos that does not pose a direct threat (unless neighboring cards in the layout indicate this). But its main meaning is a new beginning and new opportunities. It’s time to leave an uninteresting job, even if it seems stable and promising. And start doing what you always wanted - to work not for money, but for your own pleasure, and financial success will not keep you waiting either.

There is no need to hesitate and doubt - once the Jester appears in the scenario, it is time to act decisively, to use the chance that has been given to you.

        "finance": "The meaning of the \"Tower\" card in the upright position in work and finance. Collapse at all levels is the main meaning of the card. Poverty, need, poverty, job loss. Sometimes there is a collapse on the mental level, when some kind of spiritual crisis occurs. Perhaps emotional burnout at work, which leads to loss of interest in professional activities. Such a crisis does not necessarily have to be destructive. To start something new, you first need to end something old. It’s the same in work - despite serious difficulties when changing one activity to another, in the future this may turn out to be the right decision. The Tower itself does not rule out such a turn of events. But more often, a revolution turns out to be spontaneous, uncontrollable. Other possible meanings: a sharp change in plans, a severe test of strength, closure of a company or business, mass layoffs. The negative event that is planned will be short-lived, but its consequences will be felt for a very long time, from one week to several years. In financial terms, this could be a natural disaster (flooding or fire) that hits real estate, as well as robbery or car theft. A person risks losing everything, including savings. Inverted “Tower” in work and finance: meaning When the card appears in an inverted position, this indicates smoothed changes, which will also be negative. For example, the loss of one job and a long search for another, awareness of the lack of career prospects. Often an inverted Tower indicates that a series of failures is coming to an end. Or the misfortune that was already literally on the threshold has receded. There will be a reason to say: “It’s gone!” Just in case, it’s worth having a plan B in stock. This applies to both work and finances. Even if a crisis breaks out, its negative consequences if there is a backup plan of action will be minimal. Possible meanings of the card for career and money: revaluation of values, worries due to financial troubles, disappointment in work, unstable situation. For those who are already looking for a new place work, you need to prepare for the fact that you won’t be able to quickly find a decent option. The incoming offers will be unprofitable, the future will be vague. But financially, it will be possible to recover relatively quickly from losses, minimize losses and their consequences. Litigation, claims, and disputes cannot be ruled out, but they will not have a strong negative effect on the fortuneteller. Advice from the “Tower” card in work and finance The main thing that is required of you now is to remain calm and sober. Act according to the situation, but not impulsively, as there is a high risk of making mistakes. Changes have already begun, and nothing can be done about it. But you can minimize the negative consequences.",
        "love": "The Tower is one of the most difficult and unfavorable cards, and its interpretation is always associated with some kind of negativity. In fortune-telling about relationships, the Tower lasso takes on a particularly alarming meaning. On the one hand, the card hints at the complex nature of the fortune-telling object, which is not ready to weigh its words and actions. At some point, the result of his imprudent actions will be the complete collapse of all plans and hopes. On the other hand, in love, the meaning of the Tarot Tower can be interpreted as the likelihood of betrayal and betrayal on the part of loved ones. It will not be easy to survive something like this; the most destructive feelings will be unleashed. The card warns: beware, some acute emotions can bury you under the rubble of your former happiness! The Tower also has another name - the Almshouse. Its meaning is transparent, because the inhabitants of such establishments are only the poor in spirit, broken people who have lost hope and the right to success. The meaning of the “Tower” card in love in the upright position In no scenario, the appearance of the Tower does not promise joy and peace. To understand this, just look at the image: before your eyes, lightning easily destroys a structure that seemed unshakable. A rich man and a poor man fall from a height to the ground - they are destined for an equally sad fate. In a love relationship, the meaning of the Tower tarot card indicates the inevitability of loss and disappointment, which neither your status nor material well-being can prevent. No matter how high you fly in your dreams, they will end in complete and final collapse: a sudden feeling that flares up will remain without reciprocity ;a long-standing and seemingly strong relationship will not survive the next conflict; a sincerely in love couple will be quarreled by a rival or a rival; the family will face a divorce, which will not be hindered by either common children or common plans. Also, for the fortuneteller, this lasso implies certain karmic debts that always have to be pay. However, in love, the negative meaning of the Tower tarot card is slightly smoothed out by hope for the future. Indeed, an acute crisis is a necessary stage for a person who dreams of changing his life for the better. But one should not deceive fate and glue together what should be broken. Just try to minimize losses: restrain aggression, do not allow yourself to be drawn into an ugly story. Inverted “Tower”: meaning in love and relationships The essence of the mentioned lasso depends little on its position - it always speaks of shock, problems, mental pain. And yet, when divining for love and relationships, the inverted Tarot Tower has a slightly less painful meaning. The Higher Powers promise that the disaster will definitely not break you. You probably anticipated it a long time ago and managed to prepare yourself mentally. Or vice versa - there is still time to “spread the straws” and soften the inevitable blow. Advice from the “Tower” card in love and relationships The meaning of this tarot arcana can be frightening, but you should remember that this is not a sentence. Rather, a recommendation: there is no need to cling to the past; it is best to come to terms with the loss and look to the future. In place of old, outdated relationships, something new will definitely appear. Just don’t rush to start “construction” on the rubble. Wait until the dust settles, give your soul time to clear itself of negativity, and only then get to work, taking into account all past mistakes.",

On the other hand, the Moon at work can also indicate the opposite situation, when they are trying to trick you or slander you, so you need to be on guard all the time. Danger is not asleep, but the events that are happening in your life are not under your control. The unpredictability of the situation is its biggest disadvantage. But the person himself often refuses to face the truth. He believes that he is an irreplaceable worker and is ready to work for pennies, not noticing that his work is simply being shamelessly exploited. Or he takes at face value his partner’s words that the business is about to take off, he just needs to take out a couple more loans and invest additional money.

As for financial issues, you can avoid unexpected expenses if you take a closer look at your business partner, including a potential one: there is something wrong with him So. The Moon is, among other things, a mental health card, and its appearance in a reading indicates that there is a problem. If not from the fortuneteller, then from someone from his work environment.

        "love": "The main meaning of the Moon in the tarot is melancholy and separation from reality, complexes, groundless fears and endless doubts. This may not be a good thing in a relationship. True, the night luminary in the reading for love has an additional meaning: the Moon patronizes poets, romantics and dreamers. If, when fortune telling about relationships with another person, the Moon lasso falls, you can assume one of two opposite options: the object of your tender thoughts knows how to feel deeply, he has developed intuition, a high level of empathy, a special gift for understanding and accepting others with all their shortcomings; you are dealing with a hypochondriac, a person who is quite capricious, insecure, prone to plunge into a whirlpool of depression with or without reason.

        "love": "The general meaning of the Judgment tarot card in a relationship is a conscious choice, achieving new heights (new position and status), ending battles and conflicts. This means that the person has finally “ripened” to the most responsible, important decisions. And if he wants to start a family, he will not do it under the influence of fleeting desires or carnal passions. It is no coincidence that the second name of the Judgment card is Revival or Rebirth. One stage of life has ended, the next is just beginning. The results were summed up, mistakes were analyzed, goals were adjusted taking into account the life experience gained. The moment has come to plunge headlong into completely new emotions and impressions. Very often, the meaning of the Judgment tarot card in a love relationship implies some veiled deceit. The person who received this lasso has long ago calculated all the consequences of his “rebirth”, but from the outside his actions will seem like a successful impromptu. The meaning of the “Court” card in love in the upright position Analyzing the layout with the Court card in the upright position, two conclusions can be immediately drawn: in the personal relationships of the fortuneteller, some important, fateful changes are coming; no matter what happens, everything will turn out for the better! The lover will achieve reciprocity. The bachelor will get married. A family man will look at his couple with a fresh look - and will understand how dear this relationship is to him. It would seem so simple. But in reality, a lot depends on the hidden, hard-won desires of the object. Let us assume that the lasso of Judgment has fallen in a relationship between spouses who have long ceased to be interested in each other, live out of habit, daily tormenting their partners with reproaches and nagging. The meaning of the card remains the same - finding what you want through some kind of enlightenment. But these people do not dream of prolonging the torment, but of freedom. It turns out that in this case, the Renaissance symbolizes a divorce - one from which everyone will benefit! Another nuance that must be taken into account. The meaning of the tarot card Judgment in love and relationships characterizes the fortuneteller himself to a greater extent than other people. The appearance of the lasso may indicate several important points: many conflicts with loved ones occur solely through your fault - you are either energetic to the extreme, or too picky and picky; if a Star appears next to the lasso Judgment in fortune telling about relationships, you are clearly a very creative person who ignores the everyday needs of the family in the name of his own spiritual growth; The Court surrounded by Pentacles (coins) will prophesy changes not in the personal, but in the material sphere - in this case, one should share good luck with loved ones. Inverted “Court”: meaning in love and relationships Paradox: if in a normal situation, this lasso can present divorce and separation as a blessing, then the inverted Judgment has the opposite meaning in a tarot reading for love and relationships. This is usually due to deep-seated feelings of guilt on the part of one of the partners. It forces you to look for excuses for yourself - and encourages you to commit strange and illogical actions. Example. A woman wants to understand why her husband has become nervous, irritable, and lashes out at her for any reason. If in a tarot reading she sees an inverted Judgment in love, it can be assumed that the spouse is experiencing a suppressed feeling of guilt. Lets say for treason. That is why, trying to whitewash himself in his own eyes, he constantly looks for shortcomings in his wife. Also, an inverted lasso, symbolizing the Renaissance, can speak of a reluctance to commit some important actions, an escape from oneself. Advice from the “Judgment” card in love and relationships The meaning of the lasso generally implies favorable life changes. But this is in theory. In practice, you should think about what exactly a person wants at the time of fortune telling. Not for others, but for yourself. Answer sincerely and honestly. Voice this decision and be sure that Fate will help you achieve what you want, you just have to take the first step in the right direction.",

Excitement, the desire to achieve something gave way to inhibition. The man slows down. He suddenly lost interest in what he was doing, or suffered emotional burnout. All thats left is work.

        "finance": "The meaning of the card \"Nine of Wands\" in the upright position in work and finance Although there is no open conflict or confrontation yet, there is a defensive position of the fortuneteller (or the one for whom the alignment is being made). And the defender is ready to take hostility to anyone who does not share his opinion or, as it seems to him, can somehow harm his work or business. In a team, such a person keeps to himself. It seems to him that everyone around him is aiming for his place, envying his position and success. There is no desire to establish friendly contact with colleagues. However, sometimes such a strategy turns out to be justified and advantageous, helping to maintain a more advantageous position at work in relation to everyone else. The problem is that often the danger or threat from colleagues, partners or competitors turns out to be far-fetched. But the person does not want to admit this, fencing himself off from real signals and information coming from outside. Hence the other meanings of the card: suspicion, conservatism, constant control, financial difficulties. The work situation remains stable, but it seems to the person that everything will collapse as soon as he weakens control. It must be said that this may indeed be the case. Money comes in, but in almost the same quantity as it is spent. Moreover, we are talking about mandatory expenses that cannot be avoided. This means that you have to make sure that no additional expenses arise, otherwise the budget will quickly go into the red. However, unforeseen expenses are very possible. We have to patch holes in the budget and solve constantly emerging financial problems.

He is suspicious, stubborn, selfish, unfriendly towards colleagues, superiors, and subordinates. Often such a person is characterized by a lack of initiative, a fear of failure, because of which he tries to do as little as possible and refuses to take responsibility. Hence problems with career advancement and financial situation. As in the case of the Nine of Wands in an upright position, the person is in a defensive position. But if it is justified there, then in this case the resistance to change is caused not by a real danger, but by character traits. The need to part with savings causes panic. The entry of new income is hampered by the position taken - the reluctance to change something and do something in order to start earning more. Advice from the Nine of Wands card in work and finance It is worth listening to the wise advice of others, they will allow you to better understand the situation. If you keep to yourself, you may miss out on opportunities that could change your life for the better.",

In the first case, you have to solve a problem that actually exists. This takes a lot of effort and requires complete concentration on the task at hand. In the second case, the problem exists only in the head. An excessive sense of duty or false responsibility does not allow you to relax and forces you to work even where it can be entrusted to someone else without compromising the result. And if no one has asked a person for this yet, then he is unlikely to receive a well-deserved reward. Other meanings of the card: troubles, chronic fatigue, heavy burden, constant pressure, excessive load. It is interesting that not only work, but also, for example, the success achieved.

The direct position of the Four of Pentacles says in plain text: if the system is functioning normally, there is no need to interfere and improve something; the direct path is visible to the very horizon - you can go towards your goal without turning anywhere; now money begins to work on its own thanks to previously made competent investments; the accumulated capital is enough to start your own business or fulfill your cherished dream. Among other “money” lasso, this is one of the most significant. Appearing in an upright position in a career reading, the Four of Pentacles promises the achievement of stratospheric heights. The only limiting point is the limit of personal desires and ambitions. Unfortunately, such carte blanche in work, business and finance does not always go hand in hand with inner comfort. For some people, complete happiness requires struggle, overcoming obstacles, eternal boiling and burning. The absence of these incentives stops the desire to develop, which is natural: if you have reached the top, there is nowhere to strive. Boring. The meaning of the Four of Pentacles can change significantly in the vicinity of other arcana.xa0 For example, next to the Queen of Swords, the card advises being more loyal to subordinates and colleagues.

Advice from the “Four of Pentacles” card in work and finances Everything is fine with my career, and there are no problems with money either. Perhaps the time has come to take a break from Napoleonic plans and relax. For example, arrange a holiday for the soul, for no reason.

Despite the fact that the family has everything and from the outside it seems happy, the person lacks warmth. He feels uncomfortable. Although the relationship is stable, it does not move forward or develop. Living together is like a vicious circle. Inverted “Four of Pentacles”: meaning in love and relationships There are also two meanings here - both positive and negative. Next to other cards that have a positive meaning, the lasso may indicate that everything is fine in the couple. There is both material wealth and mutual understanding based on mutual respect. There are also problems, but they are not hushed up, but are quickly resolved. Relationships are based on honesty and generosity. A reversed card can also indicate liberation from a relationship that was very burdensome due to constant control from a partner or was maintained out of habit, without love. Negative interpretation of the card - the couple remains together only because one holds on to the others money or status. Although this may happen through no fault of his own, as a temporary phenomenon - one partner temporarily has no income and is financially dependent on the other. Other meanings of the card: absolute dominance of one of the partners, material wealth is placed higher than love, unwillingness to take risks when entering into a new relationship, attachment to material things, adherence to traditions and habits, conservatism.

        "finance": "The meaning of the Six of Pentacles card in an upright position in work and finance When divining for work and career prospects, the upright position of the Six of Pentacles indicates good options for growth, the opportunity to achieve success and rise. Unfortunately, the easiest way to do this is at the expense of other people - by humiliating, substituting, manipulating. And here the result depends on the presence of internal moral and ethical stoppers. Arkan immediately gives two important recommendations for diametrically opposed situations: when using the protection of an influential person, be prepared to fall into long-term dependence on him, just keep in mind that the loss of freedom can be too expensive; extending your hand to the fallen , make sure that he really needs it and is ready to rely on you, otherwise you risk finding yourself in a funny, awkward situation. In a money scenario, the meaning of the Six of Pentacles card is clearly simpler. Arkan reports that the easiest way to achieve success and financial independence is to use borrowed funds. The purpose of the loan is not discussed, the fact itself is important. And vice versa: having the opportunity to lend a certain amount to your friend, partner, colleague, do not refuse financial assistance.

On the other hand: when planning to make a donation, make sure that it is appropriate - you can be blatantly used, “conned”; do not allow yourself to be held responsible for the fate of other people, an artificially instilled sense of guilt is the main weapon manipulators. Fact: financial relationships of unequal partnership, indicated by the inverted Six of Pentacles, more often become a source of negative emotions than sincere gratitude. Advice from the “Six of Pentacles” card in work and finance When planning to ask for help, find out in advance what will be required in return.

        "finance": "The meaning of the \"Seven of Pentacles\" card in an upright position in work and finances When it comes to finances, the meaning of the Seven of Pentacles does not bode well. Manna from heaven will not fall on your head; any kind of prosperity can be achieved through hard, unproductive work. The saddest thing is that hopes for the best begin to rapidly fade: expenses become more and more, incomes are catastrophically unable to keep up with them; as soon as illusory stability appears, some kind of force majeure immediately occurs, emptying the wallet and piggy bank; an inferiority complex develops, everything falls out of hand , you want to spit and stop resisting the blows of Fate; an obsessive fear of losing that little that still keeps you afloat appears. Paradox: in an attempt to protect yourself from chronic stress, a person convinces himself that he is happy with everything. As a result, an existence begins according to the principle “I have enough,” in which you can get stuck for many years, until the end of your life. With a career, everything is the same. The Seven of Pentacles in an upright position can only guarantee a low-paid job that is unloved, does not bring any satisfaction, and is worn out. Living wage - and not a penny more. There are zero prospects, no chance of achieving a promotion. Reversed “Seven of Pentacles” in work and finance: meaning When it seems that things can’t get any worse, the Seven of Pentacles falls in an inverted position. This situation says that the person has broken down morally or is very close to it. He stopped waiting and hoping. The routine is stuck. Work becomes an everyday feat. Bosses cause hatred, and colleagues cause dull irritation. There is only one step left to acute psychosis with all the ensuing consequences. What does the inverted Seven of Pentacles card mean in a money spread? The lasso guarantees that a person is not in danger of starvation, but he always has to save on everything. No trips to cafes and restaurants, no new things, vacation - at the dacha, with a hoe. It’s embarrassing in front of friends, ashamed in front of relatives. In such a situation, artificial self-isolation seems to be the best way out. Its easier, calmer. If a miracle does not happen, a person will hide in a deaf shell and forever cut off all paths to success. Advice from the Seven of Pentacles card in work and finance Try to understand how you got to this situation. What makes you think that guaranteed poverty is a level to strive for? Allow yourself to at least dream about a different life. Maybe at this point she will really start to change for the better!",

Some tarot readers claim that the intended goal, for which you work hard to achieve, will be achieved no earlier than in a year. In love and relationships, this could be a planned wedding or pregnancy. The negative meaning of the card is still the same - growth, changes, but very slow .

The efforts of one of the parties will be in vain. Perhaps one partner did not live up to the expectations of the other. Or the relationship as a whole was disappointing and turned out to be not what you dreamed of. The understanding comes that a lot of effort was spent in vain. You dont get what you expected.
