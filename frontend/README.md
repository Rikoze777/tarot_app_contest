# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequirements
Node.js 18+

## First Step
In order to run successfully you should add into .env file parameter `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http..` with value of your backend URL

## Second Step
Follow frontend subfolder and install all dependendies
```bash
cd frontend/ && npm install
```

## Run dev or build to production
`npm run dev` to start local serve on port 3000 (in this case you should point your proxy to this port)
`npm run build` to build frontend into `dist` folder (in this case you should distribute frontend as static files)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

### `npm run preview`

Starts preview server base on builded sources.
Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) to view it in your browser.
